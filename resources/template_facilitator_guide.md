# Training Facilitator Guide

The purpose of this document is to include all necessary information regarding the preparation and planning of the training.

It can also be provided as a checklist with timing information
- what to do before, during and after the training

Information that should be included:
- where are all of the materials that should be used during the training
    - digital materials location
    - physical resources and equipment needed
        - e.g. projector
        - e.g. activity resources such as card decks
        - etc.
- how to prepare the materials beforehand
    - e.g. something needs to be written on the flip charts
- how to prepare the learning environment
    - room layout and any other specifics (e.g. name tags, sign-in sheet, etc.)
    - in case of an online training this includes preparation of the virtual room, providing access, sending out or publishing reading materials, etc.
- specific details and notes should be available in the unit lesson plan

## Parts you have to update before you start a new course

- Syllabus, especially:
	- Type
	- Date
	- Location
	- Duration
	- Agenda
- Release notes
- New version and publication on Zenodo

## Activity: LEGO® Metadata for Reproducibility

If you want you can start your course on Electronic Lab Notebooks by using the LEGO® Metadata game.

**Task:**
- Task 1: Build a small vehicle and make notes on how to replicate the build (15 minutes).
- Task 2: Using the resources provided by the previous group, attempt to replicate their build (10 minutes).

**Discussion:**

- How was it? What was helpful? What was missing?
- How was the documentation?
- How was the reproduction?

- How helpful were:
	- Free text vs. template
	- Stone list
	
- What does this have to do with research (data management)?

- How do you document your research (data)?

After that game you can start directly with your content about Research data management, Good research practise and Data documentation.

## Activity: Menti

Set up a [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) with the following questions:

**Exercise 0.1: Short introduction**

- Let us know: Who are you and what is your field of expertise?
	- *Word Cloud*
- What kind of research data do you work with?
	- *Word Cloud*
- Have you ever used a Lab Notebook?
	- *Ranking: Yes/No*
- Have you ever used an Electronic Lab Notebook? If yes, which one?
	- *Ranking: Yes/No*
- What do you know about Electronic Lab Notebooks?
	- *Open Ended*

**Exercise 1.1: Reproduction crisis**

- Have you ever failed to reproduce an experiment?
	- *Scales: Someone else's/My own from 1: No, never to 5: Yes, more than once*
- What can help researchers to reproduce experiments? What are the advantages of research data management?
	- *Open Ended*

**Exercise 1.2: Good research practice**

- What influence does this policy have on your daily work? How does it affect your research? How do you document your research (data)?
	- *Open Ended*

**Exercise 1.3: Data documentation**

- How do you document your research (data)?
	- *Multi Choice with the following Options:*
		- *Readme Files*
		- *Metadata*
		- *Data Management Plans*
		- *File naming/Folder structure*
		- *Codebook*
		- *EndNote/OneNote*
		- *(Electronic) Lab Notebooks*
		- *Others*
		- *None*

**Exercise 2.1: ELN Finder**

- Now it is your turn: Go to the website of [ELN Finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/) and look for an ELN that fits your needs. Which one might be a good solution for you? Name it.
	- *Word Cloud*

Don't forget to add the QR-Code of your Mentimeter to your slides.
