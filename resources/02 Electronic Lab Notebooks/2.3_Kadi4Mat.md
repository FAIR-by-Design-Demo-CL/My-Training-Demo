# 2.3 Example: Kadi4Mat

>The content in this section is adapted from [RDM@KIT](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/servicestools_tools_kadi4mat.php).

[Kadi4Mat](https://kadi.iam.kit.edu/) (Karlsruhe Data Infrastructure for Materials Science) is a virtual research environment (VRE) that was developed at KIT. It is used for the administration and analysis of research data from the research areas of materials science and macromolecular chemistry, but can also be used for other disciplines. Kadi4Mat is based on open source software. The modular and generic architecture with many interfaces makes it possible to meet the specific needs of different scientists from different research disciplines. Kadi4Mat is one of the tools of the [NFDI4Ing](https://nfdi4ing.de/community-hub-2/).

## Learning Content Topic

### What is Kadi4Mat?

- Karlsruhe Data Infrastructure for Materials Science (Kadi4Mat)
- Open Source Software
- Developed at the [Institute for Applied Materials (IAM)](https://www.iam.kit.edu/mms/) at KIT
- Generic ELN, originally from the field of Material Science
- One of the tools of the National Research Data Infrastructure for Engineering ([NFDI4Ing](https://nfdi4ing.de/de/))
- Uses a lot of interfaces to various programs

“The goal of this project is to combine the ability to manage and exchange data, the repository, with the possibility to analyze, visualize and transform said data, the electronic lab notebook (ELN). Kadi4Mat supports a close cooperation between experimenters, theorists and simulators, especially in materials science, to enable the acquisition of new knowledge and the development of novel materials. This is made possible by employing a modular and generic architecture, which allows to cover the specific needs of different scientists, each utilizing unique workflows. At the same time, this opens up the possibility of covering other research disciplines as well.“
