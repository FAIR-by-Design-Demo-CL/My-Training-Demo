# 2.3 Example: Kadi4Mat

>The content in this section is adapted from [RDM@KIT](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/servicestools_tools_kadi4mat.php).

[Kadi4Mat](https://kadi.iam.kit.edu/)Â (Karlsruhe Data Infrastructure for Materials Science) is a virtual research environment (VRE) that was developed at KIT. It is used for the administration and analysis of research data from the research areas of materials science and macromolecular chemistry, but can also be used for other disciplines. Kadi4Mat is based on open source software. The modular and generic architecture with many interfaces makes it possible to meet the specific needs of different scientists from different research disciplines. Kadi4Mat is one of the tools of the [NFDI4Ing](https://nfdi4ing.de/community-hub-2/).

## Learning Content Topic

### What is Kadi4Mat?

- [Kadi4Mat](https://kadi.iam.kit.edu/) stands for Karlsruhe Data Infrastructure for Materials Science
- Open Source Software
- Developed at the [Institute for Applied Materials (IAM)](https://www.iam.kit.edu/mms/) at KIT
- Generic ELN, originally from the field of Material Science but can be used from various disciplines
- One of the tools of the National Research Data Infrastructure for Engineering ([NFDI4Ing](https://nfdi4ing.de/de/))
- Uses a lot of interfaces to various programs

The goal of this project is to combine the ability to manage and exchange data, the _repository_ component, with the possibility to analyze, visualize and transform said data, the _electronic lab notebook_ (_ELN_) component.

#### Components
- KadiWeb
- KadiStudio
- KadiAPY
- KadiFS
- KadiAI

#### Hands-on Kadi4Mat
- tba
## Summary

- Kadi4Mat is an ELN that was developed at KIT
- It is used for the administration and analysis of research data from the research areas of materials science and macromolecular chemistry, but can also be used for other disciplines.
