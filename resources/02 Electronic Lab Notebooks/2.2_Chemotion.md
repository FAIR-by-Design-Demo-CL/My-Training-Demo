# 2.2 Example: Chemotion

>The content in this section is adapted from [RDM@KIT](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/servicestools_tools_chemotion.php).

[Chemotion](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/home/welcome) offers a free-to-use infrastructure and open source software for the management of research data, especially for chemists and related sciences. Chemotion includes a suite consisting of an [electronic laboratory notebook](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/researchdata_rdm_eln.php) ([Chemotion ELN](https://www.chemotion.net/)), a [web repository](https://doi.org/10.17616/R34P5T) and helpful tools. The goal is to simplify routine work with molecular data, thus increasing the amount of open data and improving the quality of the information obtained and published.  
The software is increasingly being extended to related fields and further developed into a generic ELN (“[LabIMotion](https://chemotion.net/docs/labimotion)”). You can find more information about Chemotion on the [website](https://www.chemotion.net/), as well as via [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/setup-own-eln/), which regularly holds events such as [Q&As and hands-on workshops](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/events/), and via the [Chemotion ELN YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@chemotioneln9781?cbrd=1&ucbcb=1).
