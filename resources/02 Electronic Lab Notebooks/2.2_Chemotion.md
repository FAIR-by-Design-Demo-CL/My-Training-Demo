# 2.2 Example: Chemotion

>The content in this section is adapted from [RDM@KIT](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/researchdata_rdm_eln.php).

**For planning, conducting and analyzing research experiments, electronic laboratory notebooks are becoming more and more common, thus contributing to the digitization of research.**

Laboratory notebooks play an important role in the **planning, conducting and analysis of (natural) scientific experiments**. Lab books are traditionally analogue and paper-based, an approach that is no longer up-to-date, as research data is primarily available in digital form. The solution are **electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs)**. These offer significant [advantages](https://www.publisso.de/en/research-data-management/rd-documenting/benefits-of-an-eln). They can be linked directly to laboratory devices, analysis software or storage systems, making results more reproducible and research more efficient.

There is now a whole range of ELNs adapted to the **various needs of different scientific disciplines**. Two of them are [Chemotion ELN](https://chemotion.net/) and [Kadi4Mat](https://kadi.iam.kit.edu/), both developed at KIT. More information on these two ELNs can be found at the section "[Services & Tools](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/servicestools.php)".

For assistance on selecting and implementing an ELN, please refer to the [ELN Guide](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006425772) and the [ELN Finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home).

## Learning Content Topic

### What is Chemotion?

- [Chemotion](https://www.chemotion.net/)  is an Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) & Repository for Research Data
	- [Chemotion ELN](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/eln) - an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN)
	- [Chemotion Repository](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/repo) - a data repository
- Subject-specific for Chemistry and related fields
- Open Source Tool
- Developed at Institute of Organic Chemistry (IOC) / Institute of Biological and Chemical Systems – Functional Molecular Systems (IBCS-FMS) at KIT
- Connected repository for publication of data
- [Recommended ELN](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/setup-own-eln/) of the [National Research Data Infrastructure for Chemistry (NFDI4Chem)](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/)

### Demo
- [Demo](https://demo.chemotion.ibcs.kit.edu/home)
- General information on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnOcKV-MTTg&list=PL1AonKd9WAd8cDjzXGiNu0ndoctNu0izs)

## Summary

- Documentation of research processes and results is important
- One tool for this is the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN)
- ELNs have many advantages over the classic laboratory notebook, and can be fully implemented in the research data management process
- There are different categories and providers of ELNs, therefore it can be helpful to use one of the presented tools to select the right ELN
- At KIT two ELNs have been developed (Chemotion and Kadi4Mat), both can be used for your own research
