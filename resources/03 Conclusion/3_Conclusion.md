# Conclusion

- **Documentation** of research processes and results is important
- One tool for this is the **electronic laboratory notebook (ELN)**
- ELNs have many advantages over the classic laboratory notebook, and can be **fully implemented in the research data management process**
- There are **different categories and providers of ELNs**, therefore it can be helpful to use one of the presented tools to select the right ELN
- At KIT two ELNs have been developed (**Chemotion** and **Kadi4Mat**), both can be used for your own research
