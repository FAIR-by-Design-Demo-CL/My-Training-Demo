# Learning Unit Template

Introduction

## Learning Objectives
- min one learning objective using the verbs from the Blooms taxonomy

## Target Audience
- who is this learning unit meant for

## Duration
- time needed to learn the provided content

## Prerequisites
- list any knowledge that is required so that the learning unit can be followed

## Learning Tools

- list any tools that are necessary to be used to complete the learning unit
- examples include required software, access to resources, etc.

## Learning Content Topic

How do I start with my own material? Use the [FAIR-by-Design Methodology](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/) for that.

1. Start with the **Backward instructional design process** described in [Ideating](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%201%20%E2%80%93%20Prepare/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects/02-Preparing%20FAIR%20Learning%20Objects_cont/).
	1. Purpose
	2. Target Audience
	3. Prerequisites
	4. Overall Scope of the learning materials
	5. Learning Objectives
2. Think about your [Content concept map](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%203%20%E2%80%93%20Design/04-Conceptualisation/04-Conceptualisation/#content-concept-map)
3. Write your [Syllabus](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%203%20%E2%80%93%20Design/04-Conceptualisation/04-Conceptualisation/#syllabus)

## Summary

At the end provide a short summary of the main points of the learning unit (these are the key takeaways that help reflect on the learning outcomes)

## Suggested Reading
- provide a list of references for further reading that should help clarify the content of the learning unit and elevate the knowledge level
- [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/), free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown.
