Introduction

### Content of this Learning material

This course will start with a short **introduction into the basic principles of research data management** ([01 Introduction to Research Data Management](../01%20Introduction%20to%20Research%20Data%20Management/RDM_content.md)).

Then we will dive into the topic of **Electronic Lab Notebooks**. We start with a **introduction** ([2.1_Introduction_Electronic_Lab_Notebooks](../02%20Electronic%20Lab%20Notebooks/2.1_Introduction_Electronic_Lab_Notebooks.md)), where you will learn what are the advantages of ELNs. Afterwards we will have a look at two Electronic Lab Notebooks that were developed at KIT (**Chemotion** and **Kadi4Mat**).
