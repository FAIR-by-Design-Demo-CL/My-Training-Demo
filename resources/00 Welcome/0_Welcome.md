## Content of this Learning material

This course will start with a short **introduction into the basic principles of research data management** ([01 Introduction to Research Data Management](../01%20Introduction%20to%20Research%20Data%20Management/1_RDM.md)).

Then we will dive into the topic of **Electronic Lab Notebooks**. We start with an **introduction** ([2.1_Introduction_Electronic_Lab_Notebooks](../02%20Electronic%20Lab%20Notebooks/2.1_Introduction_Electronic_Lab_Notebooks.md)), where you will learn what are the advantages of ELNs and how to choose an ELN that fits your needs. Afterwards we will have a look at two Electronic Lab Notebooks that were developed at KIT: **Chemotion** and **Kadi4Mat**.
