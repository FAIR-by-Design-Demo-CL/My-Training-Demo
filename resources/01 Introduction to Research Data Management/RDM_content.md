# 1.1 Introduction to Research Data Management

This section provides a short introduction into the principles of research data mangement. Its purpose is to provide the basic knowledge of research data management needed as a prerequisite for Chapter 2.

Please note that this section will not go into too much detail as there are many courses out there describing the principles of research data management. At the end of this section links will be provided about where you can find further information.

## Learning Content Topic

### What is Research Data?

>The content in this section is adapted from the [DFG Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data](https://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/foerderung/grundlagen_dfg_foerderung/forschungsdaten/guidelines_research_data.pdf.).

<span style="background:rgba(160, 204, 246, 0.55)">"Research data is an essential foundation for scientific work. The diversity of this data reflects the wide range of different scientific disciplines, research interests and research methods. Research data might include measurement data, laboratory values, audiovisual information, texts, survey data, objects from collections, or samples that were created, developed or evaluated during scientific work. Methodical forms of testing such as questionnaires, software and simulations may also produce important results for scientific research and should therefore also be categorised as research data."</span>

### Why research data management?

"More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments." (Baker 2016)

"More than half pointed to insufficient replication in the lab" (Baker 2016)
### Good Research Practise
